<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

```@qphi/publisher-subscriber``` is a module built with Typescript as UMD module. It aims to implement most event / messaging patterns in your js or ts projects.

This module provide two main interfaces:``PublisherInterface`` and ``SubscriberInterface`` that describe how your vanilla object could share **notification** in order be reactive and work together.

ðŸ‘‰ <i><u>Note that it is not an academical **pubsub pattern**</u></i>.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Prerequisites

* Add the module to your project 
  ```sh
  npm install qpi/publisher-subscriber --save
  ```

That's all! Now you can start to play with the notification system!

### Send your first notification

```js
import {Publisher, Subscriber} from "@qphi/publisher-subscriber";

const publisher = new Publisher('publisher-id');
const subscriber = new Subscriber('subscriber-id');

subscriber.subscribe(publisher, 'notification-string-example', () => {
    console.log("Hello world! I am an happy handler!");
});

publisher.publish('notification-string-example');
// => "Hello world! I am an happy handler!"
```


### Send parameters on publish 

```js
import {Publisher, Subscriber} from "@qphi/publisher-subscriber";

const publisher = new Publisher('Paul');
const subscriber = new Subscriber('bar');

subscriber.subscribe(publisher, 'hi', name => {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${name}! Nice to meet you!`);
});

publisher.publish('hi', publisher.getId());
// => "Hi, my name is Paul! Nice to meet you!"
```

### Combine Publisher and Subscriber roles 

An instance of ``PublisherSubscriber`` implements ``PublisherInterface`` and ``SubscriberInterface``. That mean that it can ``subscribe`` to some notifications and ``publish`` too.

This kind of instance is helpful when you have to manage several components or implements a workflow.
```js
import { PublisherSubscriber } from "@qphi/publisher-subscriber";

const worker = new PublisherSubscriber('worker');
const manager = new PublisherSubscriber('manager');

worker.subscribe(manager, 'new-mission-available', jobId => {
   console.log(`${worker.getId()}: "${manager.getId()}" ask somebody to do the job "${jobId}".`);
   // some business logic here
   console.log(`${worker.getId()}: job "${jobId}" is done.`);
   worker.publish('job-done', jobId); 
});

manager.subscribe(worker, 'job-done', jobId => {
    // some business logic here
    console.log(`${manager.getId()}: "${worker.getId()}" notice me that job "${jobId}" was done.`);
});


manager.publish('new-mission-available', 'foo');
// => worker: "manager" ask somebody to do the job "foo".
// => worker: job "foo" id done.
// => manager: "worker" notice me that job "foo" was done.
```

### Best Practices

#### Kill your component properly
Cause a subscription might keep a references to some object (according to the handler), memory leak could occur if you didn't clear properly subscriptions. That's why we advise to manually call ``destroy`` method under a ``publisher`` or a ``subscriber`` as soon as you know that it won't be used anymore. In some context, it is not critical cause your instance will automatically be cleared (browser context reset by new navigation). 
  
#### Avoid publish in handler, unless you implements PublisherSubscriberInterface
In subscription handler you should not let another publisher publish a new notification. Unless ``subscriber``implements ``PublisherSubscriberInterface`` avoid to publishing in handler at all. 
```js
// Naive example of stack-overflow 
// In real world it could be happen when a subscriber handler involve another publication
subscriber.subscribe(publisher, 'hello', () => {
    publisher.publish('hello');    
});

publisher.publish('hello'); 
```
